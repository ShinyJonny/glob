A terminal windowing and UI library for rust applications.
The library is focused on efficiency and currently is based on shared buffers.
Support for colors and dynamic layouts is currently in development.
This library is used to power my projects [roggame](/projects/roggame) and, in the future, [hexvi](/projects/hexvi).
